	"orgDescription": "The Charles River Conservancy is a nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing and maintaining the parks and natural habitats along the Charles River in Greater Boston. Through ecological restoration, volunteer stewardship, and public engagement, CRC works to preserve biodiversity and promote equitable access to green spaces. Its initiatives include invasive species management, environmental monitoring, and creative programming in urban wilds like Hell’s Half Acre.",
	"description": "As a volunteer with CRC, I contributed over 80 hours to invasive species monitoring and urban park restoration along the Charles and in Hell’s Half Acre, an urban wild in Cambridge, MA. In addition to my fieldwork as a CREW Steward and Vegetation Monitor, I developed an ArcGIS dashboard as part of a final project for one of my graduate courses. The tool visualizes plant coverage data collected by volunteers and is now featured on CRC’s website. Though created independently, the dashboard was designed to support CRC’s restoration efforts and make ecological data more accessible to both the organization and the public.",

	"description": "At 18b TIP, I led the development of an interactive GIS dashboard using ArcGIS Experience Builder to centralize community resources for formerly incarcerated individuals in Suffolk County. The dashboard is actively used by the organization’s team of social workers and their interns to recommend geographically relevant services to their clients. Working iteratively with my supervisor, I structured the data, designed the interface, and introduced layered filtering tools to support intuitive navigation and personalized outreach. The dashboard continues to evolve as the team’s needs grow, offering a flexible platform for ongoing updates and community engagement.",

	"description": "As part of my graduate practicum, I worked remotely with MassDOT to digitize speed regulation records into a centralized GIS layer. My focus was on Southeast Massachusetts, contributing to a broader effort to improve data consistency and accessibility across the state. While I didn’t visit the region in person, the project gave me practical experience with structured workflows and highlighted how foundational GIS work supports larger transportation planning initiatives. This foundational effort supported broader planning and analysis across the agency.",
